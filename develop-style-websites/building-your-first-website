Setting Up the HTML Document Structure
Working with Visual Studio Code & Sublime Code to edit my code. 
All HTML have a <!DOCTYPE html> <html>, <head> and <body>
To include metadata that provides information about the HTML document.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a web page.</p>
  </body>
</html>

Self-Closing Elements
Also, known as void elemenst, the <meta> doesnt have a closing tags and encodes the characters for the content..
Other common selfclosing elements to research:
<br><embed><img><meta><wbr><input><param><hr><link><source>

Code Validation; ensuring we follow correct linting to write our code.
