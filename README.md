# Introduction to My Web Development Journey

As part of my journey to become a software engineer, I am enrolled in the [100Devs bootcamp](https://100devs.org/), a free, community-driven program designed to equip aspiring developers with the skills needed for a career in software engineering. In the second class of this 30-week bootcamp, I focused on the fundamentals of HTML, learning how to structure content for the web effectively. To further enhance my skills, I am leveraging the comprehensive and beginner-friendly [“Learn to Code HTML & CSS” course by Shay Howe](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/), which provides clear and organized lessons on both HTML and CSS, covering topics from basic semantics to advanced styling techniques like the box model and floats.

This GitHub repository represents the practical application of the knowledge I’ve gained from both the 100Devs bootcamp and Shay Howe’s course. My goal is to build a strong foundation in web development by creating projects that demonstrate my ability to structure web pages with HTML and style them with CSS. This repository is the starting point for my next development arc, where I will continue to refine my skills, explore more complex web development concepts, and contribute to real-world projects.

The 100Devs bootcamp emphasizes not only technical skills but also community and collaboration, with a motto of “Be Kind, or Get The Fuck Out.” Inspired by this ethos, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaboration from the 100Devs community and beyond as I work to improve my projects and grow as a developer. This repository will evolve as I progress through the bootcamp, incorporating new skills and showcasing my development journey.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I look forward to sharing my progress as I continue to learn and build!
