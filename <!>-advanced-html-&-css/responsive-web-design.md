"Buiding a foundation to define its fame and shape facade, creative decisions quite literally shape a digital space"

Ensuring a consistent windows and screen resolutios, with user preferences and user installed fonts but the landscape is
changing from a flexible foundation.

"I love programming because I can bring stuff into existance "

Responsive Vs Adaptive Vs. Mobile

Responsive: Means to create declarations that effect and react to any change ased on factors like the viewport width 
Adaptive: Modified for a new purpose or a situation buiult to a group of preset factors.

Using a combination provide a perfect formula for functional websites.

Mobile: Building a seperate website accessible only to the domain of mobile users, coming with the dependencies of a new code base.

Overall, a responsive web design favoring design that dynamically adapts to different browser and device viewports

Flexible Layouts
Components: Media Queries: Flexible Media: 
Flexible Layouts: Using grids that are able to dynamically resizing to any width and built using 
relative length units most commonly percentages or em units. This relaive lengths are then used to declare 
property balues such as width, margin or padding. 

CSS3 introduced new relative new units 
wv: viewports width
vh: viewports height
vmin:  Minimum of the viewports height & width
vmax: Mximum of the viewports height and width

Ofc Flexible layouts do not advocate the use of fized mesurements such as pixeks or inches.
Reason being viewport chnges from device and devuce for layouts.

Identifying the proportions of a flexible layout use relative values 
by tading the width of an element and then dividing by the width of its parent element.

target รท context = result

Flexible Grid
Uisng it within a two column layout wrapping both the section and aside elements.

HTML
<div class="container">
<section>...</section>
<aside>...</aside>
</div>

CSS
.container {
width: 538px;
}

section, aside {
margin: 10px;
}

section {
float: left;
width: 350px;
}

aside {
float: right;
width: 158px;
}

Taking all fixed units of length and turn them into relative units.

section, side {
mrgin: 1.858%; /* 10px รท 538px = .0185*/
}

section {
float: left;
width: 63.197%; /* 340px รท538px = .6319 */
}

aside {
float: right;
width: 29.36%; ?* 158px รท 538px = .2936

Taking the flexible layout concept, formula and reapplying it to all parts of a grid will create a dynamic website, scaling to every viewport size. 
Leverage the use of the min-width, max-width, min-height & max-height

But it isnt enough, at times the width of a browser viewport scaling the layout to create columns that display content.

Media Queries
Built with extensions to different media types that we can target when included in our styling, allowing us to specfify the different styles for individual browser and device circumstance with the width of the viewport or device orientation. Link: https://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/

Intializing Media Quries 
Used inside the existing stylesheet we add additional HTTP requests

HTML
<link href="href.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all and (max-width: 1024px)">

Much like the decoration we apply a 

CSS
/* @media Rule */
@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

/* @import Rule */
@import url(styes.css) all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

Each media query has a media type followed by one or more expressions 
Media Types: all, screen, print, tv and braille. 
Theres even 3d-glasses added to the list but the default is screen.

What follows are the features and values that are rules for that particular device of viewing in
my selectors that use properties that assign adabtive features in blocks of decorations from the casacade.


Logical Operators in Media Quries
Available within the @ and, not and only....
The 'and' Logical operator allow extra contition to be added tmaking sure the browser or device that uses a, b, c and so forth. Acting as unspoken 'or' operator

@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

The 'not' logical operator negates the query that is identified. In this case the expression below nages the color added to screen.

@media not screen and (color) {...}

The 'only' logical operator is a new operator and is 'not' recognized by user agents thus hiding stlyes from decices or browsers that dont support the media quries. Below expression selects only screens in portrait orintation that have a user agent capabale of rending query

@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {...}

Omitting a Media Type you can result to 'all' to default to all.
