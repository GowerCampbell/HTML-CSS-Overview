Responsive Vs Adaptive Vs. Mobile

Responsive: Means to create declarations that effect and react to any change ased on factors like the viewport width 
Adaptive: Modified for a new purpose or a situation buiult to a group of preset factors.

Using a combination provide a perfect formula for functional websites.

Mobile: Building a seperate website accessible only to the domain of mobile users, coming with the dependencies of a new code base.

Overall, a responsive web design favoring design that dynamically adapts to different browser and device viewports

Flexible Layouts
Components: Media Queries: Flexible Media: 
Flexible Layouts: Using grids that are able to dynamically resizing to any width and built using 
relative length units most commonly percentages or em units. This relaive lengths are then used to declare 
property balues such as width, margin or padding. 

CSS3 introduced new relative new units 
wv: viewports width
vh: viewports height
vmin:  Minimum of the viewports height & width
vmax: Mximum of the viewports height and width

Ofc Flexible layouts do not advocate the use of fized mesurements such as pixeks or inches.
Reason being viewport chnges from device and devuce for layouts.

Identifying the proportions of a flexible layout use relative values 
by tading the width of an element and then dividing by the width of its parent element.
